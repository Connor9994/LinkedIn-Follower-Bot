[LinkedIn Follower Bot](https://github.com/Connor9994/LinkedIn-Follower-Bot)

### Key Features

- **Automated Account Following**: Automatically follow potential connections based on your LinkedIn network growth.
- **Weekly Limits**: Prevents exceeding a threshold (100 accounts) to avoid flags or restrictions from LinkedIn.
- **Daily Execution Check**: Ensures the bot runs only once a day.
- **Log Management**: Maintains a log of the dates of each 25-account interval for easy tracking.

### **[NoDriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver) Instead of Selenium**
Official successor of the Undetected-Chromedriver python package that does NOT use WebDriver

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required library by running:

```bash
pip install nodriver
```

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Chrome/Chromium Browser
- LinkedIn Account
- Proper setup of paths in the script

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Connor9994/LinkedIn-Follower-Bot.git
   cd LinkedIn-Follower-Bot
   ```

2. Modify the paths in the script as necessary for your system. 
   ```
   browserPath = Your Chrome Directory
   (Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe)
   (Depending on your IDE, you may want to make a copy outside of any administration folders)
   (We started using a chromium download in the local directory to avoid any issues)
   
   profilePath = Where you want to save your LinkedIn User Data
   (Eg. C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\LinkedIn Follower Bot\Users\LinkedIn)

   LoggedIn = (1 Logged In / 0 Logged Out)
   ```

4. Run the script with LoggedIn = 0:
   
   (Press Enter To Save Credentials to profilePath)

   ```bash
   python LinkedInFollower.py
   ```
6. Run the script with LoggedIn = 1:
   ```bash
   python LinkedInFollower.py
   ```

## üìú Usage

The script will read from `AccountLog.txt` to check prior follow activity and will execute the follow actions accordingly:

1. Checks if the bot has run today, or if the weekly following limit has been reached
2. Launches Chrome
3. Scrolls through the LinkedIn network page to find accounts to follow
   - (From "People you may know based on your recent activity")
5. Follows the accounts dynamically until the 25-person limit is reached
6. Logs the activity/date in `AccountLog.txt`

## üöß Disclaimer

Use this bot responsibly. Automation goes against the Terms of Service of LinkedIn, and excessive use will result in account restrictions. 

Always ensure to adhere to LinkedIn guidelines. 

This is for educational purposes only!

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the script, enhance features, or fix bugs.
