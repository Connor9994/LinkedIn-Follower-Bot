## üöÄ This fork now features full Linux support and a user-friendly Terminal User Interface (TUI) for easier configuration and execution! üöÄ

## Overview


Welcome to the **LinkedIn  Bot Follower** project! This tool automates the process of following LinkedIn accounts, helping you grow your professional network with ease. The project includes a Terminal User Interface (TUI) that lets you configure key parameters before launching the appropriate bot script for your operating system.

![2025-02-1805-15-57-ezgif com-resize](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7775fdbc-f1ce-4b4c-9011-631319ceed71)

This repository contains:

- **TUI Script (`TUI-bot_Launcher.py`)**: A user-friendly interface to select your OS and enter required configuration values.
- **Bot Scripts**:
  - `botlinkdinW.py` for Windows
  - `botlinkdinL.py` for Linux

## üîë Key Features

- **Automated LinkedIn Following**: Follows up to 25 new accounts per run.
- **Weekly Limit Check**: Prevents exceeding a weekly following limit to help avoid detection.
- **Daily Execution Check**: Ensures the bot runs only once per day.
- **Custom Configuration via TUI**: Set your Chrome executable path, profile path, and login status easily.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Automatically selects the correct bot script based on your OS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Chrome or Chromium Browser
- A valid LinkedIn account
- [NoDriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver) library

Install the required library using:

```bash
pip install nodriver
```


## üõ† Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/capi-nemoo/LinkedIn-bot-Followers
   cd LinkedIn-bot-Followers
   ```

2. Review and, if needed, modify the default paths in the bot scripts:

   - For Windows: `botlinkdinW.py`
   - For Linux: `botlinkdinL.py`

3. Use the TUI script to configure your settings before running the bot.

## üìú Usage

Launch the TUI script with:

```bash
python TUI-bot_Launcher.py
```

The TUI will prompt you to:

- **Select Your OS**: Choose between Windows and Linux.
- **Enter Chrome Executable Path**: Provide the full path to your Chrome or Chromium executable.
- **Enter Profile Path**: Specify the directory where your LinkedIn user data should be saved.
- **Set Login State**: Input `1` if you are logged in, or `0` if not.

Based on your selections, the TUI will automatically launch the corresponding bot script with your provided configuration.

### How the Bot Works

1. **Pre-Execution Checks**:
   - The bot reads `AccountLog.txt` to verify if it has already run today or if the weekly follow limit has been reached.
2. **Browser Launch**:
   - It launches Chrome/Chromium with your specified profile.
3. **LinkedIn Interaction**:
   - The bot navigates to your network page, scrolls to find accounts, and follows up to 25 new accounts.
4. **Logging**:
   - The action is logged in `AccountLog.txt` for tracking.
